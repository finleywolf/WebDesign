<h1>High Fidelity</h1>
<h2>A film by Stephen Frears</h2>
</header>


  <p>High Fidelity is a nostalgic film about a man played by John Cusack who grapples with the aftermath of a breakup by looking back to his past breakups. He is a record shop owner and music is a big theme througout the film. It is not my favorite movie, I actually get quite annoyed by the main character. I just thought about famous first lines and find the opening line to this film funny. "What came first, the music or the misery?"</p>

  <div class="scene">
<h3>Scene 1 </h3>
<p>We open on Rob listening to a song by the 13th Floor Elevators called, You're Gonna Miss Me. He delivers the famous first line: "What came first, the music or the misery?" He continues with this, "People worry about kids playing with guns, or watching violent videos, that some sort of culture of violence will take them over. Nobody worries about kids listening to thousands, literally thousands, of songs about heartbreak, rejection, pain, misery, and loss. Did I listen to pop music because I was miserable? Or was I miserable because I listened to pop music?"</p>

<h3>Scene 2</h3>
<p>Rob launches into his first list: his desert island, all time, top five, most memorable breakups. Rob loves to make lists of things, usually coming in groups of five. We see this appear more with his friends as they list off their various picks for their top five whatevers. He lists, in chronological order: Alison Ashmore, Penny Hardwick, Jackie Alden, Charlie Nicholson, and Sarah Kendrew.</p>

<h3>Scene 3</h3>
<p>Rob runs after his latest ex girlfriend who we assume just walked out the door, and yells, “Do you see your name on that list, Laura? Maybe you’d sneak into the top ten, but there’s just no room for you in the top five, sorry! Those places are reserved for the kind of humiliation and heartbreak you’re just not capable of delivering.” He turns to his record player, turns the music up louder, and runs to the window. He opens it, sticks his head out, and yells out to a car across the street with Laura getting in. He yells, “If you really wanted to mess me up, you should’ve got to me earlier.” </p>

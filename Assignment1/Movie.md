# High Fidelity
## A film directed by Stephen Frears
"What came first, the music or the misery?"
I think this is a really funny and clever opening line for this film that I enjoy. 
It's not my favorite film, we follow a whiny man the whole time, yet it has a charm and nostalgia about it 
that I do enjoy. The opening line also just paints a funny picture that somehow music could cause more 
misery than any other painful thing in this world.

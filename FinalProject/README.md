I learned so much while making this website. Mainly about my abilities when it comes to coding and how difficult it can be. I learned about the importance of attention to detail, of perseverance, and of reaching out when you need help. It wasn't always easy for me to work on this course, yet slowing down, asking for help, and taking it step by step made all the difference to me. Learning to have patience and grace for myself was also a huge lesson here. 
I am really just so proud that I was able to complete a website and make it through this course without seriously wanting to drop it. I am proud of all of the elements I was able to create, especially the animation bits. It was very satisfying to see my confusion and frustration pay off when I was able to see the elements working on the actual site. Everything with Flexbox and Grid were also really cool to see how they worked on the site.
There is so much about my website that needs to be refined and I feel inspired to go back and fix the layout issues and replace the images with ones I have taken to make it feel all the more personal. I would make the navigation far simpler and easier to, well, navigate. I am aware that it is not the most polished website but I have learned to give myself grace especially as this is my second website ever and I was able to create something like this from scratch.

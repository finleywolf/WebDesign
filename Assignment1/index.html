<h1>High Fidelity</h1>


<h2>A Film by Stephen Frears</h2>


<p>High Fidelity is a film about music, love, and freindship. It follows our main character
as he navigates a breakup and reminisces on his past relationships. The lead is played
by John Cusak and funnily enough his sister, Joan Cusak, plays a small role as well. 
It is silly and cute and the fall weather makes me want to watch again.</p>

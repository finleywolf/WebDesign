I had a tricky time figuring this out at first, but I kept at it and I was able to figure out how to get the flexbox and grid and am honestly pretty proud of myself. It was really helpful to delve into these layouts after touching on them for the last project. I think that in the future they will come in a lot of handy with organization.

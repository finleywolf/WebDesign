# High Fidelity

## A film by Stephen Frears

High Fidelity is a nostalgic film about a man played by John Cusack who grapples with
the aftermath of a breakup by looking back to his past breakups. He is a record shop 
owner and music is a big theme througout the film. It is not my favorite movie, I 
actually get quite annoyed by the main character. I just thought about first lines and
find the opening line to this film funny. "What came first, the music or the misery?"
